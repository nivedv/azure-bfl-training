# Create a Microsoft Azure resource <!-- match title in metadata above (and Learn Exercise unit and ILT slide)-->

In this exercise, you’ll use the Azure portal to create a resource. The focus of the exercise is observing how Azure resource groups populate with created resources.

This exercise should take approximately **15** minutes to complete. <!-- update with estimated duration -->

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You'll need access to an Azure subscription with sufficient permissions to create a resource group and a virtual machine to complete this exercise.

## Task 1: Create a resource group
In this task, you'll create a resource group. By creating a resource group for this exercise, it will make it easier to clean up the exercise when you're complete.

1. Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?azure-portal=true).
1. Select **Resource groups**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Select the subscription you will use for this exercise from the **Subscription** dropdown list.
1. Enter `IntroAzureRG` for the resource group name.
1. Select a region that is available in your subscription or course environment.
1. Select **Review + create**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. Select **Home** to return to the Azure portal home screen.

## Task 2: Create a virtual machine

In this task, you’ll create a virtual machine using the Azure portal.

1. Select **Create a resource**.
1. Select **Infrastructure services** from the Categories menu.
1. Select **Create** under the virtual machine heading.
1. The Create a virtual machine pane opens to the basics tab.
1. Verify or enter the following values for each setting. If a setting isn’t specified, leave the default value.

    | **Setting**                  | **Value**                                       |
    | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
    | Subscription                 | Select the subscription you selected in Task 1. |
    | Resource group               | IntroAzureRG                                    |
    | Virtual machine name         | `my-vm`                                         |
    | Region                       | Same as IntroAzureRG                            |
    | Zone options                 | Leave default                                   |

    | Security type                | Leave default                                   |
    | Image                        | Leave default                                   |
    | VM architecture              | Leave default                                   |
    | Run with Azure Spot discount | Unchecked                                       |
    | Size                         | Leave default                                   |

6.  Select **Review and Create**.
6.  **Select Create**.

Wait while the VM is provisioned. Deployment is in progress will change to Deployment is complete when the VM is ready.

## Task 3: Verify resources created

Once the deployment is created, you can verify that Azure created not only a VM, but all of the associated resources the VM needs.

1.  Select **Home**
2.  Select **Resource groups**
3.  Select the **IntroAzureRG** resource group

You should see a list of resources in the resource group. By default, Azure gave them all a similar name to help with association and grouped them in the same resource group.

Congratulations! You've created a resource in Azure and had a chance to see how resources get grouped on creation.

## Clean up
1. From the Azure home page, under Azure services, select **Resource groups**.
1. Select the **IntroAzureRG** resource group.
1. Select **Delete resource group**.
1. If present, Ensure **Apply force delete for selected Virtual machines and Virtual machine scale sets** is checked.
1. Enter `IntroAzureRG` to confirm deletion of the resource group.
1. Select **Delete**.
1. On the Delete confirmation pop-up window, select **Delete**.
